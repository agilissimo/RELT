This is an implementation of the RELT algorithm published by Jie Hao, Chad Allen Gabrysch, Chunying Zhao, Qiaoming Zhu and Kang Zhang

The main motivation behind this is to be able to display a tree or some hierarchical structure on a small display. With regards to agilissimo, being able to display a story with features, tasks, subtasks, bugs and impediments is a feature that I find very practical.
